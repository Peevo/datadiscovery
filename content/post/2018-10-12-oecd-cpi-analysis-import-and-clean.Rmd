In this post I'll look at the steps to import, clean and begin modelling a real world dataset exploring longitudinal Consumer Price Index changes for OECD countries. This data has been pulled from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/oecd-org/oecd-consumer-price-index-of-all-items", target="_Blank">Kaggle</a>.  For this exercise, we'll look at the CPI changes across Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load repositories
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Our data is sitting in a unique csv file for each country.  We'll start slow by inspecting the shape of the data and construct a method for pulling/cleaning this information to suit our needs.

```{r}
# Import to AUS object from csv
AUS <- read_csv("C:/Users/squin/Desktop/Blog/Data/consumer-price-index-of-all-items-in-australia.csv")

# Check strucure
str(AUS)
```

Our value column is listed as a character, so we'll look at that more closely before converting to a number.  

```{r}
# List unique values, check for inappropriate strings
unique(AUS$value)
```

Looks like the import converted the numeric values to strings, we'll convert them to numeric as "Value" (note case sensitivity here).


```{r}
#  Set up a new column with converted Values
AUS$Value <- as.double(AUS$value)

# Check new column
unique(AUS$Value)
tail(AUS)
```

Values are showing as dbl data, so we'll go ahead and plot the data.


```{r}
ggplot(AUS, aes(x = date, y = Value)) + geom_line()

```


Looks good!  We can shorthand this process by piping the code through.  We'll try this with our next file which is canada.

```{r}
## Import Canada file and set to object CAN
CAN <- read_csv("C:/Users/squin/Desktop/Blog/Data/consumer-price-index-of-all-items-in-canada.csv") %>%
    mutate(Value = as.double(value))
## Plot data to verify
ggplot(CAN, aes(date, Value)) + geom_line()

```

Whilst both these techniques are fine, if we're working with multiple files it's probably better to load them in en masse.  We can use list.files and lapply to condense the data into a single dataframe.  Within the same piped function, we'll mutate in the nested file data, unnest it, clean and remove unwanted columns

```{r}
# change set current wd and change wd to our file source.  This is only required if the files 
# are in another directory to your working.
path <- "C:/Users/squin/Desktop/Blog/Data"
setwd(path)

# Regex codes required for string matching. 
# \\ escapes the match string as "." is a special character.  
# $ denotes the end of string.
imp <- list.files(pattern = "\\.csv$")
imp

# Read in CSV files whilst retaining the file names (for row identification), clean up 
df <- tibble(File = imp) %>% 
    mutate(Data = lapply(File, read_csv)) %>%
    unnest(Data) %>%
    mutate(Value = as.double(value)) %>%
    select(-realtime_end, -realtime_start, -value)
    
head(df)      
```

This is a good start, but let's make it a bit more readable by replacing the filename with a country shorthand.

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(Country =  c("NZ", "USA", "AUS", "CAN") [grepl("new-zealand", File)+2*grepl("united-states", File)+3*grepl("australia", File)+4*grepl("canada", File)]) %>%
  select(-File)
 
df
```

Great! Let's plot it.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = Value, colour = Country)) + geom_line()

```



We now have a dataset ready to go. Next post we'll do some analysis on the full data set and see what sort of insights we can gain.
